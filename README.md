# credit-risk-classification
Module 20 Challenge

## Background

In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Requirements

Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
- Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns.
- Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split. 

Create a Logistic Regression Model
- Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train). 
- Save the predictions on the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model. 
- Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:
- Generate a confusion matrix. 
- Generate a classification report.
- How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels? 

Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report 
- Provide an overview that explains the purpose of this analysis.
- Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the machine learning model. 
- Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you don’t recommend the model, justify your reasoning. 

Coding Conventions and Formatting 
- Place imports at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings and before module globals and constants. 
- Name functions and variables with lowercase characters, with words separated by underscores.
- Follow DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles, creating maintainable and reusable code. 
- Use concise logic and creative engineering where possible.
